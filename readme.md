## AdventofCode

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
